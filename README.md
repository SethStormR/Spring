# Spring

Spring is now full Dark Mode compatible
---------------------------------------

Spring icon set is based on WhiteSur, Bloom and Papirus icon set. Spring is aimed for Deepin Linux OS and other Linux Distribution that comes with Deepin. The icon set will work poorly in other DEs as it have only been tested in Deepin.

Feel free to request icons for applications you are using. To make thing easier add the name of the icon(s) for requested applications. It will make my life much easier than hunting the name of the different icons, thanks.
